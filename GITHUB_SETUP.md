# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name the repository: `cits5206-individual-repo-for-report`
4. Set it to **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Local Repository to GitHub

Copy and paste these commands in Terminal (make sure you're in the correct directory):

```bash
cd ~/cits5206-individual-repo-for-report
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cits5206-individual-repo-for-report.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Access Your Coverage Report

After GitHub Pages is enabled (takes 5-10 minutes), your coverage report will be available at:

```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/cits5206-individual-repo-for-report/docs/coverage/
```

## Expected Result

âœ… **Working Coverage Report URL** that you can use in your individual report:
- Interactive HTML coverage report
- Line-by-line coverage visualization
- Detailed module breakdowns
- Professional presentation for academic submission

## Troubleshooting

- If Pages doesn't appear, make sure repository is **Public**
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling Pages for deployment
- Check the **Actions** tab for deployment status
- Ensure the docs/coverage/index.html file exists in your repository
